# Area_Optimization
Pseudocode_With_LSTM-like_Interface

This program uses what I call an LSTM-like approach for extimating location and it does so carrying information about these locations throughout the entire programming sequence. This enables visual evaluation of placement and ensures that one can see how "free area" changes with the addition of every individual feature............. Still a work in progress but a fine piece of art!
